Content There are three classes here.

Shoe Sandal Boot Inspiration This dataset is ideal for performing multiclass classification with deep neural networks like CNNs. You can use Tensorflow, Keras, Sklearn, PyTorch or other deep/machine learning libraries to build a model from scratch or as an alternative, you can fetch pretrained models as well as fine-tune them.

Acknowledgement This dataset is a modified version of a large image dataset provided by M.Stephenson.
